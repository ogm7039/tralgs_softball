# tralgs_softball

Welcome to Tralgs Softball github. Tralgs Softball is a personal project by Owen Manley. It is a website surrounding our rec-leauge softball team, it is intended to emulate a website for a real sports team, complete with roster, schedule, and stats. The website uses SQL to create a database and uses RESTful APIs to fetch data from the database. Client end to come soon.
